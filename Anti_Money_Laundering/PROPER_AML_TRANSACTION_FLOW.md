# 🛡️ Proper AML Transaction Flow Implementation

## ✅ **Fixed Transaction Flow**

### **🚨 Previous Problem:**
- ❌ Money was deducted FIRST
- ❌ Risk assessment happened AFTER money movement
- ❌ No way to reverse flagged transactions

### **✅ New Correct Flow:**

```
1. VALIDATE → 2. ASSESS RISK → 3. DECIDE → 4. EXECUTE (if approved)
```

## 🔄 **New Transaction Process**

### **Step 1: Pre-Transaction Validation**
- ✅ Account status check
- ✅ Balance verification
- ✅ Basic validations

### **Step 2: Risk Assessment (NO MONEY MOVEMENT)**
- ✅ NLP/Keyword analysis
- ✅ Rule engine evaluation
- ✅ Country risk assessment
- ✅ Transaction saved with risk score

### **Step 3: Decision Based on Risk Score**
- **APPROVED (< 60)**: Execute money movement immediately
- **FLAGGED (60-89)**: Hold transaction, await manual approval
- **BLOCKED (≥ 90)**: Reject transaction, throw exception

### **Step 4: Money Movement (Only if Approved)**
- ✅ Execute actual balance changes
- ✅ Update account balances
- ✅ Log successful completion
